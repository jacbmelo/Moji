 * Recovery drafts on disk.
 *
 * Each draft owns a content file, and a small manifest holds only ids and titles. Saving one
 * draft therefore rewrites that draft plus a few hundred bytes of manifest, never the text of
 * every other draft.
 *
 * Size is bounded by the machine rather than by a fixed character count: every write is checked
 * against a memory budget and the free space on the volume, and a write that does not fit is
 * refused whole, with the numbers behind the refusal. See `draftCapacity.ts`.
 *
 * Autosave appends edits to a per-draft journal instead of rewriting the snapshot, so the cost of
 * a keystroke follows the size of the edit. The journal is folded back into the snapshot once it
 * grows past `COMPACT_JOURNAL_BYTES`, which bounds both its size and the work done at startup.
 *
 * Layout under `userData`:
 *   drafts/manifest.json   { version, drafts: [{ id, title }] }
 *   drafts/<id>.md         snapshot, readable by hand if recovery is ever needed
 *   drafts/<id>.journal    edits appended after the snapshot, one JSON array per line
