# appearance Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-markdown-viewer-editor. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Clean minimal template
The system SHALL present a clean, minimal, distraction-free interface: generous reading width, clear typographic hierarchy, and controls that stay out of the way of the content.

#### Scenario: Distraction-free reading layout
- **WHEN** a document is displayed in view mode
- **THEN** the content is shown in a centered, readable column with consistent spacing and no unnecessary chrome

#### Scenario: Reading column follows configured percentage
- **WHEN** the user sets a reading width between 20% and 100% in 5% increments in Settings
- **THEN** the preview shows a centered column using that percentage of the available preview width for every document
- **AND** the column keeps a 480px readable minimum, capped by the available preview width on narrow windows

#### Scenario: Reading width persists across launches
- **WHEN** the user changes the reading width, closes the app, and reopens it
- **THEN** the previously configured reading width is applied on startup

#### Scenario: Toggle full reading width
- **WHEN** the user toggles reading width while a document is in view mode
- **THEN** the preview switches between the configured width and the full available width for the current session

#### Scenario: Preview starts with default reading layout
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** the full-width toggle is off, and the preview font size and reading column use the persisted configured values (16px and 60% by default)

### Requirement: Adjust font size in view and edit modes
The system SHALL let the user increase, decrease, and reset the font size in both view mode and edit mode, from the top-bar font-size control, from the keyboard, and from Settings. Each mode SHALL keep its own size between 12px and 24px, so changing one never changes the other. Both sizes SHALL persist across launches.

#### Scenario: Adjust preview font size
- **WHEN** the user increases, decreases, or resets the font size while a document is in view mode
- **THEN** the preview font size changes within 12px-24px, resetting to 16px
- **AND** the editor font size is unchanged

#### Scenario: Adjust editor font size
- **WHEN** the user increases, decreases, or resets the font size while a document is in edit mode
- **THEN** the source editor font size changes within 12px-24px, resetting to 14px
- **AND** the preview font size is unchanged

#### Scenario: Font size control follows the active mode
- **WHEN** the user switches between view mode and edit mode
- **THEN** the top-bar control and the Ctrl+Plus / Ctrl+Minus / Ctrl+0 shortcuts read and change the font size of the mode now on screen

#### Scenario: Set font size from Settings
- **WHEN** the user opens Settings and sets a font size in the Preview tab or the Editor tab
- **THEN** the preview or the editor, respectively, applies that font size immediately, independent of the other tab's value

#### Scenario: Font sizes persist across launches
- **WHEN** the user changes either font size, closes the app, and reopens it
- **THEN** both the preview and the editor start at the sizes last configured

### Requirement: Light and dark theme
The system SHALL provide both a light and a dark theme and let the user toggle between them at any time from the top bar. The whole application — chrome, source editor, modals, and preview content — SHALL adapt to the active theme with adequate contrast. Exports SHALL always use the light theme.

#### Scenario: Toggle to dark theme
- **WHEN** the user toggles the theme to dark
- **THEN** the entire UI, including the rendered preview and code blocks, switches to dark styling with readable contrast

#### Scenario: Toggle back to light theme
- **WHEN** the user toggles the theme to light
- **THEN** the entire UI switches back to light styling

### Requirement: Persist theme preference
The system SHALL remember the last selected theme and apply it on the next launch.

#### Scenario: Theme restored on restart
- **WHEN** the user selects a theme, closes the app, and reopens it
- **THEN** the previously selected theme is applied on startup

### Requirement: Follow system theme by default
On first run, the system SHALL default to the operating system's color scheme preference. Settings SHALL offer System, Light, and Dark; while System is selected, the app SHALL follow OS changes live.

#### Scenario: First run matches OS
- **WHEN** the user launches the app for the first time with the OS set to dark mode
- **THEN** the app starts in the dark theme

#### Scenario: Follow OS changes
- **WHEN** the theme preference is System and the user switches the OS between light and dark
- **THEN** the app switches theme without a restart

#### Scenario: Toolbar toggle leaves System mode
- **WHEN** the theme preference is System and the user presses the top-bar theme button
- **THEN** the app switches to the opposite theme and stores it as an explicit Light or Dark preference
